                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">In its first generation, introduced to the world in 1978, the Japanese saw the light in a decade marked by the oil crisis, where sports cars equipped with huge low-consumption engines were at a low point of popularity and a different approach was needed. <br>
                            <br>
                            The result was a sports car measuring 4285 mm (168.7 in) in length, weighing about 1000 kg (2205 lb), and possessing an attractive design that matched the prevailing style of the time: sharp lines combining straight lines and curved surfaces, retractable headlights or the always accurate (though not very practical) detail of mounting mirrors above the front wheels. <br>
                            <br>
                            In Europe, the engine delivered only 105 horsepower (104 HP; 77 kW) and 14.7 kg·m (144 N·m) of torque, while in Japan it would reach 130 horsepower (128 HP; 96 kW) and 17 kg·m (167 N·m), respectively, with a five-speed manual gearbox with which it accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 8.5 seconds and reached 200 km/h (124 mph). Its consumption was about 11 L/100 km (9.1 km/L; 21.4 mpgAm). <br>
                            <br>
                            The car went on sale in Japan in 1978 before arriving in Europe the following year. With a gross weight of just over a ton, the RX-7 featured the 12A engine with 100 horsepower (99 HP; 74 kW); and a more powerful 13B RE-EGI 1308 cc (1.3 liters) with 135 horsepower (133 HP; 99 kW), depending on the market. <br>
                            <br>
                            Thanks to the mid-front engine layout, weight distribution and vehicle handling were improved. At its debut, the RX-7 featured the dual-rotor 12A engine and 1146 cc (1.1 liters); and later a turbo version appeared with 165 horsepower (163 HP; 121 kW) at 6,500 rpm and a maximum torque of 23 kg·m (226 N·m) at 4000 rpm for Japan, while in North America it obtained the slightly larger 13B engine equipped with direct fuel injection. <br>
                            <br>
                            The car was a commercial success, 471,018 units of the RX-7 were produced until its replacement by the second generation in 1985.</p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">In its second generation, the model's evolution is evident adopting a familiar style, but strongly influenced by the late 80s and early 90s era. Details such as the retractable headlights were kept, which continued even in the third generation, but others were added, such as the hood air intake or the huge rear window. The car became larger, increasing its size to 4,310 mm (169.7 in.), as well as its weight to 1,360 kg (2,998 lb) and 1,400 kg (3,086 lb) for the convertible version, using engines with higher performance. <br>
                            <br>
                            By 1985, the RX-7 had a design inspired by Porsche's coupes and a series of performance upgrades, such as the Mazda DTSS (Dynamic Tracking Suspension System) and turbocharger. <br>
                            <br>
                            Its forced induction proved particularly suitable for rotary engines, thanks to its exhaust flow characteristics and quite effective for increasing torque at medium speeds. <br>
                            <br>
                            In this second generation, the engine had 1308 cc (1.3 liters), the same initially offered 150 hp (148 HP; 110 kW) naturally aspirated in Europe, while turbocharged versions generated from 180 to 200 hp (178 to 197 HP; 132 to 147 kW). In its most powerful version, the RX-7 accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 6 seconds and reached a top speed of 240 km/h (149 mph). <br>
                            <br>
                            Once again, there was a difference between what the model offered in its local market and what it achieved in the rest of the world, with the Japanese being more benefited. While in Japan the Wankel engine produced 185 hp (182 HP; 136 kW) and 25 kg·m (245 N·m) of torque, in Europe and North America, the driver had to settle for 150 hp (148 HP; 110 kW) and 18.4 kgm (180 Nm). The model evolved and before giving way to the third generation, it delivered up to 180 hp (178 HP; 132 kW) and even 205 hp (202 HP; 151 kW) at 6,500 rpm and maximum torque of 27.5 kg·m (270 N·m) at 3,500 rpm for its Turbo and GT variants. <br>
                            <br>
                            Between 1985 and 1992, 272,027 units of the second-generation RX-7 were manufactured.</p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">In its third and final generation, which arrived in 1992, the Mazda RX-7 was a true high-performance car. With a new sequential twin-turbocharger, the engine power increased to 239 PS (236 hp; 176 kW). <br>
                            <br>
                            The chief designer was Yoichi Sato (佐藤 洋 一, Satō Yōichi). Another important designer was Wu-Huang Chin (秦 無 荒), a Taiwanese automotive artist who also worked on the Mazda MX-5 Miata. <br>
                            <br>
                            The third-generation model was considered by enthusiasts as the best of all RX-7s, for its easy handling, demonstrated 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration in 5.3 seconds, and a (auto-limited) top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). <br>
                            <br>
                            Its appearance was typical of the 90s, with much more rounded shapes than its predecessors, a long hood, body extensions, and a striking spoiler. Its length was reduced to 4280 mm (168.5 in), which combined with a height of only 1229 mm (48.4 in) and a width of 1750 mm (68.9 in), achieving very athletic and low-profile proportions. <br>
                            <br>
                            The weight was reduced to 1270 kg (2,800 lb), which benefited performance, as well as the incorporation of a rotary engine of 1308 cc (1.3 liters) with two rotors, which in the Old Continent developed 240 PS (237 hp; 177 kW), inferior to the 255 PS (252 hp; 188 kW) of the "JDM" (Japanese market) and which in its final evolution gained 40 PS (29.4 kW) more. In this one, the car managed to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 5.2 seconds, with its top speed reaching 256 km/h (159 mph). <br>
                            <br>
                            In 1996, the RX-7 was discontinued in production in most of Europe, due to emission standards, although Mazda continued to produce it for right-hand-drive markets, increasing its power thanks to a twin-turbo setup up to 280 PS (276 hp, 206 kW) at 6,500 rpm and with maximum torque of 32 kg·m (314 N·m) at 5,000 rpm. <br>
                            <br>
                            The production of the Mazda RX-7 ended entirely in 2002; 68,589 units of the third-generation RX-7 were manufactured.</p></div>
