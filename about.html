                                <p>Although Mazda has stopped producing it, it is still possible to see it at some car shows, 
                                    video games (like Need for Speed), and it is often seen on the streets of Japan. 
                                    Three models were produced: SA/FB, FC3S, and the most famous, FD3S. It is one of the
                                     few cars to use the Wankel rotary engine, which eliminates the traditional pistons, 
                                     camshafts, crankshaft, etc. This type of engine has far fewer components but has a
                                      higher specific power. However, it has the disadvantage of high wear, high fuel 
                                      consumption, and low torque at low revs. It was one of the most prestigious Asian 
                                      sports cars, along with the Acura NSX, Toyota Supra, Nissan 350Z and 370Z, and Nissan 
                                      Skyline GT-R (R32, R33, and R34).</p>

                                    There are three generations of the Mazda RX-7. The first, known as "SA22C" or "FB", comprises
                                     the models from 1978 to 1985. The second, known as "FC3S" or simply "FC", comprises the models 
                                     from 1985 to 1992. The third generation, known as "FD3S" or "FD", was released in 1992 and
